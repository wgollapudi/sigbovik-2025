## Some sample paper titles

### An analysis on the upper bound of authors of a SIGBOVIK paper
- We would just try and convience as many people as we could to sign off on the paper, pretty boring though.

### On the concerning correlation between statisical notation and brainrot
- See "sigma", "mu", "beta". Could somehow conclude that satistics is the brainrot of stem.

### Emperical employment minimization, an analysis.
- I don't know what this would consist of, but I like the idea.

## Ideas without titles

Something with "bronify". There is a concerning exponential increase in the frequency of Lebron's name being added to songs on Spotify. (Similar to that one post deducing that by 2050 the Batman frachise will have a reboot every 5 pico seconds). Because each of these new songs require space (in some data server somewhere), we can calculate humanities expected extention via these songs taking up too much space. We could also see if the energy requirement of producing the songs would push humans to extinction before the space requirement.

Upper bound of anymtotic analysis. We are always so concerned with minimizing runtime complexity. However, this is unamerican. As was proclamed by Captain America, bigger is better. We will apply this reasoning to algorithmic design.
- Develop techniques to increasing complexity.
- Is a (n^n)! algorithm possible?

Rigourus UNO theory. See [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397513008670](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397513008670).

Which is more likley, Monkeys writing Shakesphere, or pigs flying. Preform a very serious analysis of both.
